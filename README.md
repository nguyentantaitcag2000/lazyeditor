# LazyEditor Feedback Repository

LazyEditor is a powerful web-based WYSIWYG editor integrated into LazyCodet that is designed to create and manage content on the platform. Inspired by the best features of Microsoft Word and Visual Studio Code, it combines advanced text editing with code-friendly functionality, making it an ideal tool for note-taking, knowledge storage, and content creation within LazyCodet.

Since LazyEditor is not open-source, this repository serves as a central hub for **bug reports**, **feature requests**, and **general discussions** to help improve the editor with your feedback.

## About LazyEditor

LazyEditor is designed to be the ultimate editor by blending:
- **Microsoft Word**â€™s robust text editing capabilities for complex document formatting.
- **VS Code**â€™s code-editing features for a seamless developer experience.

I am building LazyEditor every day with input from our amazing communityâ€”you!

Currently, LazyEditor/LazyCodet is maintained by only one person, so if an unexpected error occurs that cannot be detected, I need you to report the error so that I can handle it faster. Thank you for your contribution.
